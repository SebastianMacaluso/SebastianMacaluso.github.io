Beam search and greedy implementations on [<u> Ginkgo </u>](https://github.com/SebastianMacaluso/ginkgo) datasets to reconstruct the most likely binary tree. Being able to perform a precise reconstruction of the truth tree would assist in physcis searches at the Large Hadron Collider. In particular, determining the nature (type) of the initial unstable particle (and its children and grandchildren) that gave rise to a specific jet is essential in searches of new physics as well as precission measurements of the current model, i.e. the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

The python package [<u> StandardHC </u>](https://github.com/SebastianMacaluso/StandardHC) contains all necessary code.
