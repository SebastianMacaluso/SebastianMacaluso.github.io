# Sebastian Macaluso

Postdoctoral Associate, New York University. <br> seb.macaluso@nyu.edu <br> <br>I am a postdoc in  <a href="https://twitter.com/kylecranmer">Kyle Cranmer</a>'s group at NYU, at the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics & Center for Data Science. I work at the interface of machine learning and particle physics, designing classifiers, working on simulations and probabilistic models, and algorithms to tackle problems in combinatorial optimization among other areas. <br> <br> My background is in particle physics and machine learning applications to collider physics. I obtained my PhD at the <a href="https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/het/">New High Energy Theory Center</a> at Rutgers University.<br>
